							<h2>What we do</h2>
							<p>
								OpenLaw NZ is an open-source legal data platform. Our goal is to improve the
								accessibility of case law and other legal information in New Zealand. We want to make it
								easier for all New Zealanders to understand law.
							</p>
							<p>
								You can use our search to find case law, and navigate between related information. You
								can also use our plugins (or write your own) to aid your research.
							</p>
							<p>
								You can use our API to build case law intelligence into your own applications and
								services. For an example, see our <Link to="/plugins">chrome extension</Link>.
							</p>
							<h2>Our data</h2>
							<div className="paragraph-with-figure">
								The data we have currently comprises High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court
								decisions from present day back to approximately 2004 (with some exceptions, for example
								some suppressed decisions and other judgments that have not been published).
								<br />
								<br />
								We developed software that extracts data from cases. We extract structured data,
								including references to other cases in our database, and to any Acts of Parliament
								(current or repealed). We use that software to power our search and API.{" "}
